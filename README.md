Psuedo++ - SD Hacks 2017 Git Repo
----------------------

Psuedo++ is a programming language we all know, english!
Insted of having strict syntax rules, Psuedo++ allows users to 
input instructions in plain english while the computer 
translates and generates the respective code. For example:

`print king kunta and add 2 and 5`

```python
print("king kunta")
var0 = 2 + 5
```

Various inputs are allowed both just one command or multiple.
Feel free to clone the repo and have fun writting the easiest
code you've ever written!
